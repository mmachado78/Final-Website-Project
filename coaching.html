      <h3>Summary</h3>

     <p>
      In the fall of 2016, I decided to turn my biggest passion into an asset for my community when I became a coach for Blue Ridge United, a non-profit youth soccer organization based in Winchester, Virginia. Each spring and fall, BRU administers a ten-week season that consists of around twenty practices and eight games. Through these events, I aimed to improve my players’ soccer abilities and connect with them on a personal level. In doing so, I provided them an escape from the various challenges they faced in their personal lives.
    </p>

      <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>I designed most of the drills I employed, my favorite of which taught how to quickly transition from defense to offense using a “hold-up striker.” Other drills were derivations of ones that professional teams practice or, more commonly, my travel soccer coaches used. One, in particular, was popular among my team due to the competition it bred and tempo at which it was run. For this drill, I organized my players into three rows of four; the line of four in the middle served as a defense, with the lines of four that sandwiched it representing an offense. The defenders had to apply the concepts of pressure, cover and balance to prevent passes from reaching the other side, while learning to shift when passes were allowed through.</p>

    <p>In addition to drills, my players partook in warm-ups and a scrimmage each practice, though I added variations to keep things fresh. To do so, I analyzed the areas that my team struggled with in its game, determined a fun manner in which to address them and prepared alternative plans in the event that multiple players were absent.</p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>

    <p>As a BRU coach, I positively impacted my community in multiple ways. For one, I improved its youth’s health through the physical activity I conducted. Perhaps more importantly, though, this position presented me an opportunity to improve the lives of children who are struggling financially. Especially at the age group I last coached, many children were playing recreational soccer because they could not afford travel soccer. As a coach, I assumed the responsibility of guiding my players toward a successful path by improving their soccer abilities so much that they can play high school soccer or simply using my knowledge and experience to provide advice.</p>
